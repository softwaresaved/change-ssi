## Style and Structure

-   Lessons are written in Markdown and compiled to HTML using the `mccole` static site generator.
    -   Each lesson should take about an hour to work through.
-   Lessons are in `slug` directories
    -   `slug` is short mnemonic
    -   Each lesson must have an `index.md` file containing its content
    -   And may also have a `slides.md` file with [Shower][shower] slides
-   Use `@/some/path/` for internal links
    -   The leading `@` is translated into a relative reference to the project root
-   The Markdown link definitions in `_extras/links.md` are appended to all Markdown files
    -   This helps ensure consistent link URLs across pages
-   Figures, code inclusions, citations, and glossary references are formatted using `mccole` shortcodes.
-   The home page for the site is generated from `README.md`
    -   The navigation menus for lessons and appendices are generated from
        the `lessons` and `appendices` `div` elements in `README.md`
-   Diagrams should be SVG files created with [draw.io][draw-io]
-   `bibliography/index.md` has the bibliography as a definition list
    -   Citation keys have IDs for linking
    -   Use an inline HTML link `b:key` in files to create links
-   `glossary/index.md` has the glossary as definition list
    -   Reference keys have IDs for linking
    -   Use an inline HTML link `g:key` in files to create links
-   The `_static` directory contains CSS and JavaScript files
-   The `_templates` directory contains [Jinja][jinja] templates used to generate HTML
